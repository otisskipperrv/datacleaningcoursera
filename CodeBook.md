Feature Selection (Taken from codebook of imported dataset (link found in README.md)) 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Data Aggregation For Project
============================
The data we are working with comes from a group of subjects (people) performing various physical activities and the above mentioned features being measured for them. 

The data set above was imported in its raw form of a feature list, activities list and train/test set from a raw data set given to us for the Data Cleaning project. The train/test set were unioned to provide all data, and then the full features and activities were appended - giving us insight into all features for each time each subject performed each activity. (More variable estimates beyond just mean and standard deviation were provided in the raw data, but these have been excluded)

This data set was then transformed to be a tidy dataset, for which each row was an observation of a subject doing an activity and the feature values were the averages of all of the mean & standard deviation observations.
